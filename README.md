# 🎌 Anime Dataset – Feature Engineering & Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting meaningful features from raw anime title data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key analytical questions.

The dataset contained structured and semi-structured information inside the "Title" column, which required text parsing, feature engineering, and datetime transformations.
